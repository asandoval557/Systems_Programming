Inventory.h
	- destructor method added then used a loop to delete all m_Items
	- delete nSize to print method 

Item.cpp/Item.h
	- delete m_Value to line 8 of the Item constructor in Item.cpp(when adding delete to line 9 I was recieving an error, I removed from line 9.
	  ran the debugger looked at where the memopry leak was originating which was the constructor. That is when I added delete m_Value between the
	  2 variables and recieved a pass.)
	- delete value to Print function
	- declared ~Item() destructor
	- defined destructor ~Item
